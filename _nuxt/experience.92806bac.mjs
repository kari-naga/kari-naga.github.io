Users of the app can tweak the reports exactly to their liking with custom formatting, advanced contact filtering with stackable and savable filters, lead scoring, and more. The lead scoring can be customized with subscores that can contribute to each other and an unlimited number of rules, all of which are resolved by solving a dependency graph. Reports render in real time as PDFs and can be saved either as PDF or CSV files for use in spreadsheeting tools or the like. I was given complete creative control over this project and made most of my design choices based on the needs of the small business owners who would be using my product. I created detailed documentation that is easily accessible for every aspect of the app, and I added admin pages for managing authorized users and delegating permissions. The entire app runs in a Google Cloud Run container for scalability and cost effectiveness, and it uses Cloud Firestore as its database to handle format and preference saving.
